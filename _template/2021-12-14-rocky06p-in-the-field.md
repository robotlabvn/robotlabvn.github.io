# Project

This is a modified version of Rocky with a GPS attachment for outdoor flights. This vehicle was used primarily for very high speed flights outdoors.  Alex added the additional modification for the GPS, and I primarily worked on rebuilding the vehicle after (many) high speed crashes. Thankfully, none of the critical components were damaged after 10+ high speed crashes. Most of the impact force was absorbed by the structural components and did not transfer to the sensors, and the modular design of the vehicle lead to fast turn-around time (~20 min) for in-field robot repairs.
