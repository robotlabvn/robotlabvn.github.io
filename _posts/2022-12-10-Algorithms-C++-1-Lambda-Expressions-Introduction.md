In C++, a lambda expression is a convenient way to define an anonymous function object or functor. It was introduced in C++11 and allows you to create inline functions for short snippets of code that are not going to be reused and therefore do not require a name. Lambda expressions are often used to encapsulate a few lines of code that are passed to algorithms or asynchronous functions, improving code readability and maintainability

A lambda expression can be defined in its simplest form as follows:

The return type in lambda expressions is usually evaluated by the compiler itself, and you don't need to specify it explicitly. The ```â†’return-type``` part can also be ignored in many cases. However, in some complex situations, such as conditional statements, the compiler may not be able to determine the ```return``` type, and explicit specification is required

## A functor
A functor, or function object, is a C++ class that acts like a function. It is an object that can be treated as though it is a function or function pointer. Functors are most commonly used along with STLs in a scenario where a function requires more information than it can accept as a parameter. Functors are objects that can be called like a function by overloading the function call operator (). They can be used to encapsulate a few lines of code that are not going to be reused and therefore do not require a name. Functors can simplify tasks and improve efficiency in many cases


___Example ```functor.cpp``` bellow:___ 

functor.cpp
{:.filename}
```c++

#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Define a functor for the predicate
class is_odd {
  public:
    bool operator () (const int n) const { return (n % 2 == 1); }
};

int main() {
	vector<int> vec {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9};

	// Pass a functor object
	auto odd_it = find_if(cbegin(vec), cend(vec), is_odd());

	// odd_it will be an iterator to the first odd element (if there is one)
	if (odd_it != cend(vec))
		cout << "First odd element is: " << *odd_it << endl;	
	//-> First odd element is: 3

}
```
We can simplify this code by using Lambda expression

___Example ```lambda.cpp``` bellow:___ 

lambda.cpp
{:.filename}
```c++

#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	vector<int> vec {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9};

	// Pass a lambda expression
	auto odd_it = find_if(cbegin(vec), cend(vec),
							[](int n) { return (n % 2 == 1); }
	);

	// odd_it will be an iterator to the first odd element (if there is one)
	if (odd_it != cend(vec))
		cout << "First odd element is: " << *odd_it << endl;	
	//-> First odd element is: 3

}
```
