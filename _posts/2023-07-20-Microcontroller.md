Please install all the software and follow the Lab tutorial and Video introduction to get familiar with MCT Lab. Next week, we will meet and get familiar with STK600 KIT. But now, In the meantime, you can try your best to do all the Lab experiments.

Note: Please following be careful with the  electrostatic discharge (ESD), and strictly follow Lab instructions to void damage and short circuit.
